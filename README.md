Emmett Makes Dotfiles
=====================

A bunch of useful dotfiles I've collected.

Often plagiarized, I'll try to give credit where possible (a lot of vimrc is from DeMarko, for example)

Installation
------------

**Warning**: This method will delete your existing vimrc and bashrc!

    dotfiles/install.sh
